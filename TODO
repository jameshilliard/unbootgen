Match ROM/FSBL parsing
  Though bootgen-generated boot images seem to be parsed correctly, the tool
  fails on boot images created by U-Boot - which boot on HW successfully. If a
  image works in the real world, this tool should be able to read it too.

Add custom exception
  When an invalid header is detected, currently a RuntimeError exception is
  raised. It would be nice to have a more approriate exception for these cases.
